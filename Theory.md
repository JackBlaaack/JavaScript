# Data Types

**Logical (Boolean)**

Boolean consists of only two values: **True and False**.
We mustn't put True or False in quotes, 'cause they'll turn into type "String".
We want to check the age of users, who enter on our website:
let age = 17;
let allowAccess = age>=18; // False


**Type null**

"null" is a type and a value in the same time. It uses for that to mark something, how nothing, empty field.

Often "null" uses when we want to initialize some parametr, which has no values.

let agreementAccepted = null;

**Type undefined**

"Undefined" is a type and a value too. When we announced a parametr and it's all Parametr's value will be "undefined".
